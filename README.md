# Project Overview

Our project is a client-side application built using the React.js framework that allows users to create and manage their daily tasks with the help of a to-do list. This to-do list aims to provide a convenient and user-friendly platform that helps users keep track of their tasks, progress, and priorities.

The website supports features like adding, deleting, and editing tasks while simultaneously sorting them in order of their priority. It enables users to track their focus time and see the statistics of their completed tasks. The user's data is stored in the Firestore feature of Firebase.

## Programming Paradigms

### JavaScript

- Functional Programming
  - Functions in JS are treated like variables
  - JS allows us to create immutable objects
  - JS has pure functions that always return the same output for a given input without side effects

### React Framework

- Declarative Programming
  - React uses a declarative programming style for concise and understandable code
  - Focus on the logic of the application

## Syntaxes & Semantics

- Functional Components
- Arrow Function (Shorter form of functional components)
- JSX (HTML + JavaScript, embedding JS in HTML)
- Props (Used to pass data from parent to child components)

## Document Object Paradigm
